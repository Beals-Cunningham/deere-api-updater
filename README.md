        -- Function --
            This script is designed to do the following:
            - Populate the form with a list of John Deere equipment from(?)
            - Give a user a way to submit a list of John Deere equipment by name through a form
                - This could be a text area, a multi-select, a dropdown-to-text, or a two-column-jumper.
                - For now, I'm leaning towards multi-select.
            - Look up and identify the URL for each piece of equipment in the SQL database
            - Query the John Deere API for the equipment (getting the URL from the SQL database), looping through if needed
            - Parse the resulting JSON, looking for: 
                - "bullet points"
                - "features"
                - "specs"
                - "accessories"
            - Update the SQL database with the results

        -- Progress --
            - August 3rd
                - Initialize repository and roadmap
                - Using an hard-coded sample URL, parse the JSON (bullet points)
                - Get sample equipment selection and "fetch URLs"
            - August 4th
                - Populate equipment list from SQL database (very slow!)
                - Get equip_link value from SQL database for each selected equipment on form submission
